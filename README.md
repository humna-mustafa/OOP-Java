# OOPs-Java
---

## Description
This repository contains all my **Java programs, labs, and exercises** for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) course** at **COMSATS University Lahore**.  

It serves as a **personal course repository** where I push all assignments, exercises, and mini-projects completed during the semester.  
The goal is to **practice Java fundamentals and OOP concepts**, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and more.
